Help on function get_global_generator in module tensorflow.python.ops.stateful_random_ops:
get_global_generator()
Retrieves the global generator.
This function will create the global generator the first time it is called,
and the generator will be placed at the default device at that time, so one
needs to be careful when this function is first called. Using a generator
placed on a less-ideal device will incur performance regression.
Returns:
The global `tf.random.Generator` object.
